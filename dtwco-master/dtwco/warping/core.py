           k : int
              parameter required by sakoe_chiba and slanted_band constraints.
           warping_penalty: double
              warping penalty to impose on non-diagonal path changes (default: 0)

        Specifics of constraints::
            'sakoe_chiba': warping path is constrained along the diagonal such that for
                           every i, j, the following constraint is true: abs(i-j) <= k,
                           see [Sakoe78]
            'slanted_band': generalisation of Sakoe & Chiba Band. Warping path is constrained by
                            the following equation abs(i*len(x)/len(k)-j) <= k . See implementation
                            of R package dtw.
            'itakura': The warping path is constrained by Itakura Parallelogram. See [Itakura75].
